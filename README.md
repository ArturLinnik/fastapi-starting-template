# FastAPI starting template

## About

Originally this was the environment I used for testing `docker`, `alembic` migrations or `PostgreSQL` database in an easier way but I decided to upload this a starting point for anyone who wants to create an API in FastAPI with a good directory structure and implement in the future alembic and deployments using docker compose.

### How to use it

You can start it manually with python: `python3 run.py`. Then you can check if it's working by entering [](http://localhost:8000/docs).

Or you can start it with docker: `docker compose up`. Then check [](http://localhost:8008/docs).
